# Repository: RAG Fully!

Welcome to the repository! This project contains three key components that demonstrate the use of AI technologies for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), knowledge graphs, and chatbot implementations.  

## Contents  

1. **Neo4J_RAG**  
   - A chatbot built with Neo4j and vectorstore integration for enhanced retrieval-augmented generation.  
   - **Key Features:**  
     - Utilizes Neo4j for knowledge graph storage and querying.  
     - Provides efficient and contextually relevant responses using vector embeddings.  

2. **PDF-AnswerBot**  
   - A bot designed to answer questions based on PDF documents using a knowledge graph.  
   - **Key Features:**  
     - Extracts and organizes information from PDFs into a structured knowledge graph.  
     - Answers user queries with contextually accurate information derived from the graph.  

3. **Llangchain_Basics**  
   - A collection of files and code examples to understand RAG using LangChain.  
   - **Key Features:**  
     - Explains foundational concepts of LangChain.  
     - Demonstrates the setup and implementation of RAG pipelines.
